      <!--Project Brief-->
      <h2>Project Brief</h2>
      <p>
        This project was the final project for my 'Drawing and Imaging' class. We had to create a cite-specific collage of a specific theme, combining tactile 
        and digital elements. It was a 3-week project, including project conception, initial proposal, two review stages and a final critique.
      </p>
      
      <!--Design Process-->
      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <p>
         'In New York, we are surrounded by buildings, pollution, people and constructions. Amongst this construction, finding a natural spot seems like a breath of fresh air. 
        However, these spots, like parks and gardens, have also been constructed.' My project focussed on Central Park: a seemingly untainted natural space that's a product of 
        intense construction and gentrification.  
      </p>

        This project ended very differently from what I had initially envisioned. Initially, I photographed the lesser travelled North Central Park, 
        focussing on capturing artifice amongst the greenery. I also tried photoshopping parts of the park together.

      </div>
      
      <p>
        I planned to combine photographs and painting, 
        creating a texture with plastic and metal scraps.

      <p>
        After this first try, I realised I was most interested in close-ups of textures. The tight frame on a bunch of leaves divorced the subject from it's setting. 
        By taking close shots of natural and man-made elements, I could guide what the user would see. My collage is in a grid; at first glance, it is filled with greenery, 
        a closer look reveals posters, garbage, benches and barriers.

      </div>
      
      <p>
        Using watercolours, I tried to 'recreate' some of the photographs. These paintings appeared natural, but can not be separated from the artist as easily as constructed natural spaces.

      <!--Reflection-->
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        While this collage veered drastically from the original idea, I was pleased with the final collage. Since I was so uncertain about how it would turn out, 
        it was very satisfying to see it materialise at the end. <br>
        So, my final collage highlighted textures across Central Park: the copied, captured and created...
